#### About Me

Hi, I’m Brian Pardo, and I recently completed a PhD in theoretical astrophysics at the University of Pittsburgh.
- I’m interested in high-impact applications of quantum computing, machine learning and data science and continuing to learn new tools and techniques
- I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning and physics projects!
- Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-a-pardo/)

#### Technical skills

- Mathematics and Physics: Linear algebra, differential equations, multivariate calculus, statistics, effective field theories, general relativity
- Programming: Python (numpy, scikit-learn, pytorch, matplotlib, Jupyter notebooks), MATLAB, Mathematica, C++, Git, Linux
- Machine Learning: Data engineering, data visualization, deep learning frameworks, convolutional neural networks, optimization techniques

#### Other skills

- Research project management
- Analytical thinking and problem solving
- Scientific communication to both technical and nontechnical stakeholders
